i. Geocode RTC dataset produced by ISCE-2 (code from Simon Kraatz)

1. Generate samples 
- for CoV time series comparison
- for RMSE time series comparison
2. Compute CoV (on a monthly basis):
- for ISCE 2
- for GRD
- for GTC (Andreas Vollrath et al)
- for Gamma
- for SNAP 8
3. Compute RMSE, R2 (over forest land cover class):
- for Gamma to ISCE 2
- for Gamma to GRD
- for Gamma to GTC (Andreas Vollrath et al)
- for Gamma to SNAP 8
4. Create figures & calculate CoV ranges
